## Task Description

A binary gap within a positive integer N is any maximal sequence of consecutive zeros that is surrounded by ones at both ends in the binary representation of N.


Given a positive integer N, returns the length of its longest binary gap. The function should return 0 if N doesn't contain a binary gap.


For example, given N = 1041 the function should return 5, because N has binary representation 10000010001 and so its longest binary gap is of length 5.
